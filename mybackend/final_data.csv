0;gs;klmfdklmfd@esi.dz;A Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network for the Production of Images of Human Faces;Generative models get huge attention by researchers in different topics of artificial intelligence applications  especially generative adversarial networks (GANs) which have demonstrated good performance in data generation. In this paper  we would like to explore the potential of this class of models in producing human faces images. For that  we will use Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). Since that  the evaluation of GANs is still difficult even with the existing metrics like Inception Scores (IS)  Mode Score (MS)  Kernel Inception Distance (KID)  Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)  Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM)  etc. Thus  the best possible evaluation remains that carried out by human evaluators. This is why we propose a new hybrid measure combining qualitative and quantitative evaluation  we called this measure: Measuring the Quality of the Features of an Image (MEQFI).

1;gs;klmfdklmfd@esi.dz;Rumor Detection in Algerian Arabizi Based on Deep Learning and Associations;Infobesity has become a reality these days and we are inundated with news via social media. This rapid large-scale transmission is not always synonymous with credibility of information  which creates a thriving ecosystem for the spread of rumors. The identification of rumors on social networks is one of the most recent and important issues  because of its impacts and the difficulty of manual processing.In this work  we propose a rumor detection approach in the Algerian arabizi. It extracts information with the associations between rumors and reactions of social network users. The features extracted from the associations and other features representing the semantics of the users’ expression  are feed to an attention mechanism to compute their importance used in the construction of deep learning models.

2;gs;klmfdklmfd@esi.dz;Analysis of Students’ Emotions in an Online Learning Environment;The COVID 19 pandemic has affected several sectors of human life  including the educational system. It has led to a rapid and forced shift towards online learning. This radical change has influenced the students’ behavior  emotional state as well as their ability to learn. In order to analyze this situation  we focus in this work on the automatic detection of students’ emotions while exploiting the techniques and methods of sentiment analysis and machine learning. The proposed solution aims to predict students’ emotions and some of the aspects related to online learning from students’ reviews and then infers the attitude of students using association rules and clustering. The data-set consists of students’ answers in a forum sent at the end of sessions and semesters  annotated manually  during online learning. The obtained results using precision and recall was satisfying and favorable.;['Amal Bensba', 'Naima Ahmim', 'Chahnez Zakaria', 'Nabila Bousbia'];2022;2022 International Conference on Advanced Aspects of Software Engineering (ICAASE);https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9931587/;analysis students ’ emotions online learning environment;covid 19 pandemic affected several sectors human life including educational system led rapid forced shift towards online learning radical change influenced students ’ behavior emotional state well ability learn order analyze situation focus work automatic detection students ’ emotions exploiting techniques methods sentiment analysis machine learning proposed solution aims predict students ’ emotions aspects related online learning students ’ reviews infers attitude students using association rules clustering dataset consists students ’ answers forum sent end sessions semesters annotated manually online learning obtained results using precision recall satisfying favorable
3;gs;klmfdklmfd@esi.dz;Opinion mining in social networks for Algerian dialect; There has been a significant increase in the volume of Arabic dialect messages on social networks  providing a rich source for opinion mining research. Most research works done on Arabic dialect focus on messages written in Arabic script  with very limited scope on Latin script. In this paper  we are interested in the classification of social networks messages retrieved from Twitter  Facebook and YouTube written in Algerian dialect in Latin script into positive or negative classes using existing opinion mining approaches (lexical-based  machine learning  and hybrid). Also  we apply a regrouping process in the preprocessing step to overcome the issues related to the Algerian dialect such as the orthographic varieties to express the same word. Furthermore  we focus on the hybrid approach which consists in automatically annotating the training corpus with the lexical-based approach and then use the machine …;['Mehdi Bettiche', 'Moncef Zakaria Mouffok', 'Chahnez Zakaria'];2018;International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91479-4_52;opinion mining social networks algerian dialect;significant increase volume arabic dialect messages social networks providing rich source opinion mining research research works done arabic dialect focus messages written arabic script limited scope latin script paper interested classification social networks messages retrieved twitter facebook youtube written algerian dialect latin script positive negative classes using existing opinion mining approaches lexicalbased machine learning hybrid also apply regrouping process preprocessing step overcome issues related algerian dialect orthographic varieties express word furthermore focus hybrid approach consists automatically annotating training corpus lexicalbased approach use machine …

5;gs;klmfdklmfd@esi.dz;A new language model based on possibility theory;Language modeling is a very important step in several NLP applications. Most of the current language models are based on probabilistic methods. In this paper  we propose a new language modeling approach based on the possibility theory. Our goal is to suggest a method for estimating the possibility of a word-sequence and to test this new approach in a machine translation system. We propose a word-sequence possibilistic measure  which can be estimated from a corpus. We proceeded in two ways: first  we checked the behavior of the new approach compared with the existing work. Second  we compared the new language model with the probabilistic one used in statistical MT systems. The results  in terms of the METEOR metric  show that the possibilistic-language model is better than the probabilistic one. However  in terms of BLEU and TER scores  the probabilistic model remains better.;['Mohamed Amine Menacer', 'Abdelfetah Boumerdas', 'Chahnez Zakaria', 'Kamel Smaili'];2016;International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-75477-2_8;new language model based possibility theory;language modeling important step several nlp applications current language models based probabilistic methods paper propose new language modeling approach based possibility theory goal suggest method estimating possibility wordsequence test new approach machine translation system propose wordsequence possibilistic measure estimated corpus proceeded two ways first checked behavior new approach compared existing work second compared new language model probabilistic one used statistical mt systems results terms meteor metric show possibilisticlanguage model better probabilistic one however terms bleu ter scores probabilistic model remains better

In order to present the best offers  we construct a semantic vocabulary of the domain from the job offers corpus and initialize a profile for each user based on his Curriculum Vitae. Our method is enriching the user profiles using triggers and statistical methods following his actions regarding the job offers. The approach we propose presents to the users job offers that are the closest to their learned needs and interests which also can be updated based on his daily actions regarding these offers.;['Oualid Chenni', 'Yanis Bouda', 'Hamid Benachour', 'Chahnez Zakaria'];2015;International Conference on Theory and Practice of Natural Computing;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-26841-5_2;contentbased recommendation approach using semantic user profile erecruitment;paper propose contentbased recommendation approach domain erecruitment recommend users job offers suit profile learned preferences order present best offers construct semantic vocabulary domain job offers corpus initialize profile user based curriculum vitae method enriching user profiles using triggers statistical methods following actions regarding job offers approach propose presents users job offers closest learned needs interests also updated based daily actions regarding offers
7;gs;klmfdklmfd@esi.dz;An ontology for predicting students' emotions during a quiz. Comparison with self-reported emotions;Recent research suggests that predicting students' emotions during e-learning is quite relevant but should be situated in the learning context and consider the individual profile of users. More knowledge is required for assessing the possible contributions of multiple sources of information for predicting students' emotions. In this paper we describe an ontology that we have implemented for predicting students' emotions when interacting with a quiz about Java programming. An experimental study with 17 computer science students compares the automatic predictions made by the ontology with the emotions self-reported by students.;['Victoria Eyharabide', 'Analia Amandi', 'Matthieu Courgeon', 'Céline Clavel', 'Chahnez Zakaria', 'Jean-Claude Martin'];2011;2011 IEEE workshop on affective computational intelligence (WACI);https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5953153/;ontology predicting students emotions quiz comparison selfreported emotions;recent research suggests predicting students emotions elearning quite relevant situated learning context consider individual profile users knowledge required assessing possible contributions multiple sources information predicting students emotions paper describe ontology implemented predicting students emotions interacting quiz java programming experimental study 17 computer science students compares automatic predictions made ontology emotions selfreported students
8;gs;klmfdklmfd@esi.dz;Formalized conflicts detection based on the analysis of multiple emails: an approach combining statistics and ontologies;In Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)  it is crucial for project leaders to detect conflicting situations as early as possible. Generally  this task is performed manually by studying a set of documents exchanged between team members. In this paper  we propose a full-fledged automatic solution that identifies documents  subjects and actors involved in relational conflicts. Our approach detects conflicts in emails  probably the most popular type of documents in CSCW  but the methods used can handle other text-based documents. These methods rely on the combination of statistical and ontological operations. The proposed solution is decomposed in several steps: (i) we enrich a simple negative emotion ontology with terms occuring in the corpus of emails  (ii) we categorize each conflicting email according to the concepts of this ontology and (iii) we identify emails  subjects and team members …;['Chahnez Zakaria', 'Olivier Curé', 'Gabriella Salzano', 'Kamel Smaïli'];2009;"OTM Confederated International Conferences"" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems""";https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-05148-7_9;formalized conflicts detection based analysis multiple emails approach combining statistics ontologies;computer supported cooperative work cscw crucial project leaders detect conflicting situations early possible generally task performed manually studying set documents exchanged team members paper propose fullfledged automatic solution identifies documents subjects actors involved relational conflicts approach detects conflicts emails probably popular type documents cscw methods used handle textbased documents methods rely combination statistical ontological operations proposed solution decomposed several steps enrich simple negative emotion ontology terms occuring corpus emails ii categorize conflicting email according concepts ontology iii identify emails subjects team members …
9;gs;klmfdklmfd@esi.dz;Identifying Conflicts through eMails by using an Emotion Ontology;In the logic of text classification  this paper presents an approach to detect emails conflict exchanged between colleagues  who belong to a geographically distributed enterprise. The idea is to inform a team leader of such situation  hence to help him in preventing serious disagreement between team members. This approach uses the vector space model with TF*IDF weight to represent email  and a domain ontology of relational conflicts to determine its categories. Our study also addresses the issue of building ontology  which is made up of two phases. First we conceptualize the domain by hand  then we enrich it by using the triggers model that enables to find out terms in corpora which correspond to different conflicts.;['Chahnaz Zakaria', 'Olivier Curé', 'Kamel Smaïli'];2009;6th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science Collocated with 11th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS 2009);https://hal.science/hal-01261615/;identifying conflicts emails using emotion ontology;logic text classification paper presents approach detect emails conflict exchanged colleagues belong geographically distributed enterprise idea inform team leader situation hence help preventing serious disagreement team members approach uses vector space model tfidf weight represent email domain ontology relational conflicts determine categories study also addresses issue building ontology made two phases first conceptualize domain hand enrich using triggers model enables find terms corpora correspond different conflicts
